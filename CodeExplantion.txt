Utilised the Faker library as it is a python library that has many methods that are useful for fake data creation such as email generation methods,
data and time generation methods and many more.
The CSV library was also used to output the data as csv files, which can then be imported into our mySQL database.

Some utility functions where created, a method to output the data in a csv file as well as a method
to make sure values are unique for the primary keys

The program to generate data, calls the method generation function, which uses a for loop to fill an array with an array of all the data, which is randomly generated
utilising methods from the Faker library.
Then the array is used to write a csv file, with the specified columns, and that is outputted
The length of the csv file is specified in the count variables at the beginning
It does this for all the tables, until all the csv files are created and populated.

For any relations that are foreign keys, the value will just be randomely selected from one of the values of the corresponding table, by selecting a random value
from the array for said table
